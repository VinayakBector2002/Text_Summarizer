# Text_Summarizer
Steps for doing Automatic Text Summarization in Python 

## 1️⃣ Collect and preprocess data:

To build an AI summarization model, you will need a large dataset of news articles and their summaries. You can create this dataset yourself by manually summarizing a set of articles, or you can use a pre-existing dataset that has already been compiled.

Once you have your dataset, you will need to preprocess it by cleaning and formatting the data. This may include removing any unnecessary characters or formatting, tokenizing the text (splitting it into individual words or subwords), and padding or truncating the text to a fixed length. Preprocessing the data will make it easier to feed into your model and improve its performance.

## 2️⃣ Choose a model architecture:
There are many different approaches you can take to build an AI summarization model, and the best one for your needs will depend on the specifics of your project. Some popular options include:
Encoder-decoder architecture with attention: This type of model consists of two parts: an encoder that processes the input text and a decoder that generates the summary. The attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input text as it generates the summary.

Transformer model: This type of model uses self-attention mechanisms to process the input text and generate the summary. It is particularly well-suited for tasks like summarization, as it can handle long input sequences and capture long-range dependencies in the data.

## 3️⃣ Train the model:

Once you have chosen your model architecture and prepared your dataset, you can begin training your model. This involves feeding your training data through the model, adjusting the model's internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss function, and iterating until the model converges. The loss function measures how well the model is able to predict the summary given the input text.

During training, you will also need to split your dataset into a training set and a validation set. The training set is used to adjust the model's parameters, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance as it is being trained.

## 4️⃣ Evaluate the model:

After training your model, you will need to evaluate its performance to ensure that it is accurately summarizing news articles. You can use a variety of evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, to gauge the model's performance. Precision measures the percentage of predicted summaries that are correct, while recall measures the percentage of actual summaries that are correctly predicted. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is a good overall measure of the model's performance.

## 5️⃣ Fine-tune the model:
If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you may need to fine-tune the model by adjusting its hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or the size of the hidden layers. You may also want to try different model architectures or add more data to your dataset to improve performance.

## 6️⃣ Deploy the model:

Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, you can deploy it in a production environment, such as a web application or mobile app, where it can be used to summarize news articles for users. This may involve integrating the model into a server-side application or wrapping it in an API that can be accessed by client-side applications.
